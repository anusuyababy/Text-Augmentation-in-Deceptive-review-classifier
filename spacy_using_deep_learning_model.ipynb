This hotel is perfect, IMO. Easy check in and check out. Lovely, clean, comfortable rooms with great views of the city. I know this area pretty well and it's very convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions. We had dinner and went clubing with our friends around Division St.. We had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the Hyatt and there's even public transportation right near by but we didn't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel.

Even the 'standard' room has a separate living area and work desk. The fitness center has free weights, weight machines, and two rows of cardio equipment.

I couldn't go out for 4 days. The room was spacious and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was large and very clean. What more could you ask. We had coffee and juice left outside our door every morning at the time we requested. I managed to go to the 5th floor to see the sun terrace (outside the gym) Having a sun terrace in a city hotel is a great idea but the terrace was a bit grim. A few sunbeds on a concrete floor. There was also noise from an air conditioning unit. It could do with a bit of cheering up. What I saw of Chicago was very pleasing, it has something for everyone. Would I go back to the Omni? yes I would. \\n\",\n",

Before I arrived I tried to find out about the ' In Room Fitness ' program advertize on the corporate website. I called the 800 reservation number and the client service representative answered that the hotel did have a fitness center. I explained that I was inquiring about the ' In Room Fitness ' advertised on their website. She put me on hold and came back a few minutes later and told me that there was no such thing and that I should call the property directly. I did and got the same response. I asked if they could reserve a treadmill for my room. Again, this was a problem. When I arrived at the hotel, no treadmill was available. When I went to tour the fitness room the first night I found that they close at 9pm. When I returned to the center the following day I discovered that they charge $ 13 per day to use the fitness equipment. The pool, track and locker room are free, but to use the treadmills, etc. you have to pay $ 13 per day. This charge is not noted anywhere - - not on the website, not in any of the guest service materials in the room. The food for the conference was mediocre, but the one room service meal I had was pretty good. During one of the conference lunch sessions the postponement staff made so much noise we couldn ' t hear the speaker. The HVAC didn ' t work well in my room and I kept the windows open for most of my three dark stay. The beds were comfortable with very nice linens. I tried to get a late checkout, which was offered on a card in my room. The woman who answered the phone would only give me an hour, not the 11 - 2pm range advertised in my room. The best service I received was from the folks in the Security office. The hotel does not have safes in guest rooms, so I became very friendly with Security office as I locked up my laptop between conference sessions and every other time 1 couldn ' t carry it out of the hotel. I visit Chicago at least once a year for personal travel and will continue to stay at the Marriott properties. Only wish I had done so for this visit.\",\n",

We arrived late and maybe that ' s when they put out their second - stringers, but we felt unwelcome by the desk staff - - like we were an intrusion. I ' ll never understand this - - they ' re in the hospitality business and they ' re inhospitable! (This is getting picky, but the reception desk which is cleverly designed to look like a vintage Louis Vuitton trunk needs some maintenance. The repeated ' hectometer ' initials are peeling off - - looks like they used rub - downs where they should have silk screened for durability ). When we got to our room we found the maiden ' s ratty work shoes at the pes of the bed (yuck! ). I ' m still trying to figure out that scenario. There were no ashes - - so I ' ve ruled out spontaneous combustion. Also, to the disappointment of my daughter, the much - advertised goldfish was MIA. The bellhop (who apologized for the shoes) explained that they take away the fish when they turn down the bed '. .. is that OK? ' he said. I think the proper response at a hotel like this would have been to bring up a stinking 35C / fish to make a tired 5 - year - old happy. On the up side, the rooms cost nice and have an over - the - top decoration that my daughter loved (' I ' d like to live here! ' she said ). The bed is VERY comfortable - - my wife wants the same brand now. The bathroom is nicely appointed with quality materials and good strong shower - - except for the cheap fall - apart - while - you ' re - using - it toilet paper. Come on Kimpton! How much can a decent roll cost? The view towards the river is great (try to get one) and my daughter loved the upholstered wide ledge by the window - - she closed the curtains and was in her own ' club house ' watching the world go by from from high above the city. In short: very nice hotel - - desk staff at night could be nicer (wouldn ' t cost anything and would have made up for the maid ' s shoes! )\",\n",

I ' ve attached pictures, so you can see the considerable gap in the sofa and the lack of pillows. Comfortable it was not! The chair bottom is all broken down too.
